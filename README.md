# nasomi-scoreboard-tod-tool
You can use this tool to figure out the ToD of mob's for the NasomiXI Server 

There's nothing interesting here yet but perhaps a Node.js TS project in the future will go here if we want to figure out how to deploy
something without much trouble. There can be a github pages here as well for actually finding the data but this can live in another branch
and it will likely use just some raw JS to get the job done.
